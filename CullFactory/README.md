## Overview

- Stops objects that are not visible, or are too far from the camera, from being rendered.
    - Interior rooms, items, and lights will be culled.
    - The default settings are designed to allow zero visual artifacts or popping.
- Compatible with any mods that add cameras.

## Culling Methods

### Portal Occlusion Culling

The default culling method, this is intended to hide all objects that are not visible to a camera without affecting visuals. It does so by recursively checking which other tiles are visible to the camera through doorways and connecting pathways between tiles in the interior.

**Note for developers:** The `Doorway.Socket.Size` field is used to determine the bounds of every doorway in the interior. If the size does not encompass the entirety of the possible visible portions of the next tile, then neighboring tiles will pop out of visibility when they shouldn't.

### Depth Culling

This is a more naive method that will make tiles visible that are separated from the camera by a certain number of tiles. It may result in hallways becoming invisible in view of the camera.
